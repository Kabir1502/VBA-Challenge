# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge for Columbia Data Bootcamp
Given two files with ticker (stock) data, I wrote VBA script that cycles through the excel workbook with ticker data and analyzes all the sheets (the different quarters of the year) and returns the quarterly change for each ticker, the percent change, and the total volume. It also highlights the ticker name in green if they are positive over the quarter, or red if they are negative. Furthermore, it analyzes the data and returns the tickers with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest volume per quarter
